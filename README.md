# PHYS230-Final-Project
The repository has the following documents (excluding codes):

1. Phys_230_final_presentation.pdf which holds my non-modified presentation, along with several additional slides at the end to showcase new results.

2. Phys_230_project.pdf which is a combination of my HW 3 submission (without modifications) and a brief summary describing the state of the project at the end with corresponding math.

Each .py file in the repository has the following purpose/instructions:

1. rk_fe_numba_combined.py 

A two component liquid-liquid phase separation model represented in Section 1 of the Phys_230_project.pdf file. It consists of two different time evolution methods: Forward Euler and 4th order Runge Kutta.
The instructions to run the code consist of: 
a. Choosing preferred model parameters on lines 21-23 
b. Choosing preferred system parameters on lines 25-30
c. Deciding whether you want graphs to be shown during the simulation; line 32 (can choose steps between each graph with line 33)
d.
